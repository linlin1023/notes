enterprise-wide identifier of a store will be its code.


store will need to identify a single "primary plant" that it belongs to.


in an environment with an enterprise locations service, and individual manufactuing installations, 
this "primary plant" is going to be used to determine which nanufacturing dataset the store (and its locations)
beed to be mapped into. For example, if I have two sites, A and B each with their own installations of the manufactuing
software, connected with a single stores and locations sercice, then the shadow tables in dataset A should contain the stores and 
locations belonging to A's plants, and the shadow tables in dataset B should contain the stores and locations of B's plant(s).
Also from a classic perspective, the primary plant is one the attributes of store.
